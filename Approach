1. Introduction 
We would need to detect the languae of the given sentence

Approach
1. Tokenize the strings , strore the words and size of the words extracted 
2. Arrage the tokenized string into a data structure [fr[word,meeing]]
   a. HEre the fr is the language we want to detect and this data structre would contain the meeing of the word. 
      these words are extracted fromt the string 
   b. now for those words we do not have the meanign we would move it to another structure fr_fail[word].
3. we would check the length of the both structres 
   a. We are seeing that the words with out meeing are more , then the language is mostly not french string 
   b. We are seeing that the words with meanign are more , then the language is mostly french.
